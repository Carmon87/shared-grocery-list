# shared-grocery-list
This is a small challenge project for friends and freaks. 

## Goal
Build a full stack app to create and edit grocery lists. The list should be sharable.

## Challenge
You can use the stack you want. 
Try to build it in a weekend.
The styling is important. Make it easy to use and intuitive.

## Scenario 
1. When 2 users, Ben and Anna are using your app, if Anna adds or deletes an item to the list, Ben should see the list updated automatically.
